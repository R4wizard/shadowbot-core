=== DONE ===============================================================================================================
- Each connection now has its own connection interface (i.e. IRC, Facebook, etc)
- Each message received is now wrapped in a special object that allows for easier processing (and allows for better
  identification of source when sending a response)

=== TODO ===============================================================================================================
- Port over plugin support.
  i. Plugins should be able to be dynamically loaded from a number of sources (load in this order so plugins can be
     overridden if needed)
	 a) a file folder on the server
	 b) 'node_modules/shadowbot-plugin-*'
	 c) built-in plugins - stored in the ./src/Plugins/* folder
  ii. Plugins should be able to be added/removed/reloaded via a built in interface (this interface should support a
      command so root users can quickly clone a plugin into 'a file folder on the server' - this allows for hot patching
	  and development on the server without having to do all the git commit madness?)

- Add support for sending a response to a Message (add some functions on the Message object that call the ._connection's
  methods for sending)

- Add support for sending messages that are not as a direct response to an incoming message. This is slightly more
  complex now, as any sent message must know its target Connection type.

- Add support for a local concept of "Users". This way we can track aliases and state across the multiple Connection
  handlers. This is also where we should handle root user authentication.

- Start porting all the plugins to their own seperate git repos (or internal plugin if relevant)

- I'm sure there is much more.
